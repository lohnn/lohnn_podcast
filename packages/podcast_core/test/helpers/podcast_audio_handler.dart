// Placeholder for podcast_audio_handler.dart in test/helpers/
// This is to allow Episode.mediaItem() and related code to compile for tests.

// If PodcastMediaItem is a class:
class PodcastMediaItem {
  // Add any minimal properties if models using it require them for compilation.
  // For example, if Episode.mediaItem() tries to access episode.id for PodcastMediaItem:
  final String id;
  final String title; // Add other fields as needed by Episode's mediaItem getter
  // Minimal constructor
  const PodcastMediaItem({required this.id, required this.title});

  // If no specific fields are immediately needed for compilation by Episode model,
  // an empty class might suffice for now.
}

// You might also need to define other types from the original file if they are used
// by the parts of the code you're trying to make compilable.
// For now, just PodcastMediaItem.
